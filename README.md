## Most of things are NOT fully stable. This is first alpha build.

### Dislcaimer:
I'm not responsible for your actions - since it's not stable yet expect errors.
Downloading and sharing TV shows might not be legal in wherever you live - check your law - again I'm not responsible for your actions.
